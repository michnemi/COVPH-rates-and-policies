## Investigating Relationship between Philippines’ Covid-19 Cases and Covid-19-related Policies


It has already been more than a year since the Covid-19 pandemic struck the world and impacted people’s lives and economies of almost all countries around the globe. As a result, governments mandated and enforced various measures, policies, and safety protocols to minimize the effect of the pandemic.

In the Philippines, as of May 17, 2021, DOH reported a total of 1,149,925 cases recorded across the country (COVID-19 Case Tracker | Department of Health Website, 2021). The government has implemented national and local policies since the start of the pandemic last 2020 to reduce the burdens on healthcare facilities while vaccines are not yet widely available.

The regression model in this study estimated Covid-19-related policies’ effects on the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the Philippines. The result suggests that the lifting of travel bans has a positive statistically significant impact on the growth rates of Covid-19 cases. The hypothesized effects of the other factors also surfaced on the study’s findings. However, there was insufficient evidence to conclude their effect. Estimating the model on more samples may resolve this issue, which would also solve the non-normality of residuals.

Nevertheless, the simple model used in this analysis showed how Covid-19-related policies affect Covid-19 reported cases growth rates. Future research may modify the model specification, dig deeper at the more localized policy implementation on a regional or LGU level, and incorporate recoveries and deaths in the modeling. One caveat for this analysis is that the policies in the data were mainly on the national level, but the cases were from the local governments. Since local policies may vary in every jurisdiction, it would be a step further to investigate the relationship between Covid-19-related policies and Covid-19 growth rates in areas where the cases continue to increase despite efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
